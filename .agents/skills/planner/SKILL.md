# Writing Plans

Write comprehensive implementation plans as bite-sized tasks an engineer with
zero codebase context can execute: exact files, complete code, testing, and
docs for every task. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Context:** Plan on the existing scoped branch, never directly on `main`.
Reuse the branch's existing PR; `git-publish` only ensures one exists.

## Load first

Read `docs/agents/planner.md` and follow it. Load the approved spec first, then
every relevant doc listed by `docs/agents/planner.md`.

If requirements are missing entirely (no spec, no clear requirements), ask the
user to provide an approved spec or do a separate brainstorming/design pass. Do
not invoke brainstorming automatically.

- Investigate bounded facts available in the loaded context directly; use the
  Explore subagent for repository-wide tracing or uncertain boundaries — never
  guess file paths, module boundaries, or assumptions.

## Ordered workflow

1. **Scope check.** If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, suggest
   breaking it into separate plans — one per subsystem, each producing working,
   testable software on its own.
2. **Resolve uncertainty** (below) — plans ship with zero open questions.
3. **Map the file structure.** Before defining tasks, decide which files are
   created or modified and each one's responsibility. Design units with clear
   boundaries; prefer smaller, focused files; files that change together live
   together; follow established patterns in existing codebases.
4. **Write the plan** following `/planning-structure`: the `plan.md` index plus
   `tasks/NN-<slug>.md` files.
5. **Self-review** (below), fix inline, and report.

## Resolving uncertainty (mandatory)

Plans ship with **zero** open questions. There is no Open Questions section, and
a plan is not complete while an unresolved fork remains. Resolve uncertainty
during planning — never defer it to the reader.

- When planning reaches a genuine fork — two defensible task breakdowns, a spec
  sentence supporting two readings, an unclear dependency or rollout order —
  **stop and ask the user**, using the `question` or `AskUserQuestion` tool,
  whichever is available, always attaching your recommended answer.
- Before a task introduces an identifier for a domain concept the context glossary
  does not define, stop and resolve the term with the user through the
  `domain-modeling` skill; tasks may only name glossary terms or effect-named mechanics.
- Questions answerable from the codebase must be explored (e.g. via the
  Explore subagent), not asked.
- If a fork cannot be resolved interactively, state the assumption you verified
  and adopted, prominently, in the plan — an explicit stated assumption is the
  only permitted substitute for an answer.

## Plan artifact structure

Follow `/planning-structure` for the `plan.md` index, the `tasks/NN-<slug>.md` files, and the directory layout, file names, numbering, and slug rules.

**Plan header (every plan MUST start with this):**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For implementation agents:** Execute this plan task-by-task from the files under `tasks/`.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Global Constraints

[The spec's project-wide requirements — version floors, dependency limits,
naming and copy rules, platform requirements — one line each, with exact
values copied verbatim from the spec. Every task's requirements implicitly
include this section.]

---
```

## Task right-sizing and structure

A task is the smallest unit that carries its own test cycle and is worth a
fresh reviewer's gate. Fold setup, configuration, scaffolding, and
documentation steps into the task whose deliverable needs them; split only
where a reviewer could meaningfully reject one task while approving its
neighbor. Each task ends with an independently testable deliverable.

Choose test steps using the repository's testing guidance loaded by the role
document. The test-first sequence below applies to behavior changes; each step
is one action (2-5 minutes): write the failing test → run it to verify it
fails → implement the minimal code → run the tests to verify they pass →
commit.

This example is for a behavior-changing task; use the repository's testing guidance for test-only consolidation steps.

Each task file (`tasks/NN-<slug>.md`) uses this structure:

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ts`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ts:123-145`
- Test: the test path required by the repository's testing guidance

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: [what this task uses from earlier tasks — exact signatures]
- Produces: [what later tasks rely on — exact function names, parameter
  and return types. A task's implementer sees only their own task; this
  block is how they learn the names and types neighboring tasks use.]

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts
// Name the situation and the expected outcome in domain terms with concrete values.
it("rejects an order with no items", () => {
  expect(() => placeOrder({ items: [] })).toThrow("An order needs at least one item");
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `<the focused test command for this package>`
Expected: FAIL with "placeOrder is not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```ts
export function placeOrder(order: { items: unknown[] }): void {
  if (order.items.length === 0) throw new Error("An order needs at least one item");
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `<the focused test command for this package>`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.ts src/path/file.ts
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

## No placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are
plan failures: "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details";
"add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases";
"write tests for the above" without actual test code; "similar to Task N"
(repeat the code — tasks may be read out of order); steps that describe what
to do without showing how; references to types, functions, or methods not
defined in any task.

## Self-review

After writing the complete plan, check it against the spec yourself — not a
subagent dispatch:

1. **Spec coverage:** every requirement has a task; add a task for any gap.
2. **Placeholder scan:** no patterns from "No placeholders".
3. **Type consistency:** types, method signatures, and property names match
   across tasks.
4. **Index/task consistency:** Does every task in the plan index have a
   corresponding task file? Does every task file have a summary in the index?
   Flag any mismatch as a blocking issue.
5. **Test names:** Read every `it`, `test`, and `describe` name in the plan
   against the repository's test-naming rules and domain glossary loaded by
   the role document. Each name must state the situation and the expected
   outcome in domain terms with the test's concrete values, and must not use
   code identifiers, internal working terms, technique words, or change
   history. Rewrite every name that fails; a reviewer must not have to ask
   what a test proves.
6. **Zero open questions:** every fork resolved or carried as a prominently
   stated, verified assumption.

Fix issues inline.

## Grilling (proportional)

Use `/grill-with-docs` when the plan introduces new or fuzzy domain language or
a real, hard-to-reverse decision, pointing it at the docs named by
`docs/agents/planner.md`. A term counts as new when it is absent from the
loaded glossary, even if the spec states that no glossary addition is needed.
Skip it for plans that introduce no new terms or decisions.

## Verification

Include package-level and root verification commands, and integration tests for
cross-package changes when the project's testing guidance requires them.
Follow the project's stack-aware verification rules.

## Shell guidance

Prefer relative workspace paths in commands and examples (e.g.
`mkdir -p plans/2026-05-30-feature-name`). Avoid absolute workspace paths
unless a tool requires them.

## Completion

After saving the plan, report the plan path, docs used, and self-review
findings. Plans contain no open questions. After the user approves the plan,
commit the plan artifacts, use the `git-publish` skill to publish the branch and
ensure a GitHub PR exists, report the finalized plan path and PR URL, and stop.
Do not create an empty commit when no owned files changed. Do not invoke
implementation agents automatically — ask the user first.
